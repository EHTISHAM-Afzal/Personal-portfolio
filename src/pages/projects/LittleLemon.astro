        LittleLemon is a mobile-first full-stack web application that I
        developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). I
        learned how to build the front-end of this application from the
        <b> Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate</b> course on
        Coursera, taught by meta engineers. This e-commerce application has many
        features, such as table booking form that could store the booking data
        in a<b> MongoDB</b>
         database and use it to avoid table overbooking and a universal cart, a
        smooth shopping experience, a product showcase, and support pages. I
        created this application from scratch to demonstrate my skills and
        knowledge in front-end development.

    <h2 class="text-lime-500">Project Purpose And Goal</h2>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this project is to apply the skill I just learned. The
      project has three phases. The first phase is to build the user interface,
      which allows the user to see the design and layout of the application. The
      second phase is to make the application functional, which enables the user
      to reserve a table online. The third phase is the most extensive and
      complex, as it involves refactoring the entire application as a full-stack
      e-commerce application with all the features that such an application
      requires.

      <b> React</b> is a popular and fast front-end library that helps me create
      dynamic and interactive user interfaces with ease. I use choose them write
      JSX syntax to write HTML-like code in JavaScript and leverage the power of
      hooks, components, props and state management. <br />
      <b> Express</b>is a minimalist and flexible back-end framework that runs
      on Node.js. I used it to build RESTful APIs, handle routing, middleware,
      error handling. <br />
      <b> MongoDB</b> is a scalable and flexible NoSQL database that stores data
      in JSON-like documents. I choose it to store querries and data efficiently
      and reliably. MongoDB also supports various features such as indexing,
      aggregation, transactions, sharding and replication. <br />
      <b> Redux</b> is a state management library that works well with React. I
      choose it to manage the global state of your application in a single
      source of truth. Redux helps me avoid prop drilling, maintain consistency,
      debug easily and implement complex logic with reducers, actions and
      middleware with using <i> ReduxToolkit and ReduxQuerry</i> I leverage the
      super powers of Redux. <br />
      <b> ShadCN-UI</b> is a sleek and modern UI library that provides
      ready-made components for React projects. I choose it to create beautiful
      and responsive web pages with minimal code. ShadCN-UI also supports
      theming, customization, accessibility and animations.

    <h2 class="text-lime-500">Problems And Thought Process</h2>
    <p>
      I faced some challenges while working on this project, especially in terms
      of code organization and structure. One of the most difficult tasks was to
      create a booking form that could store the booking data in a MongoDB
      database and use it to avoid table overbooking. Another challenge was to
      implement a cart system that was managed with Redux. <br />
       I tried to make the components as reusable as possible and use props for
      minor variations.

    <h2 class="text-lime-500">Lesson Learned</h2>
    <p>
      I have successfully built an E Commerce web app using the skill that I
      recently acquired through online courses and tutorials. This project was
      not only a way to showcase my abilities, but also a valuable opportunity
      to deepen my understanding of the skill and practice it in a real-world
      scenario. I faced some challenges and difficulties along the way, but I
      was able to overcome them with perseverance and creativity. I am proud of
      what I have accomplished and I look forward to applying my skill to more
      projects in the future.
