# LittleLemon

## Project Overview

LittleLemon is a mobile-first full-stack web application that I developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). I learned how to build the front-end of this application from the **Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate** course on Coursera, taught by meta engineers. This e-commerce application has many features, such as table booking form that could store the booking data in a**MongoDB** database and use it to avoid table overbooking and a universal cart, a smooth shopping experience, a product showcase, and support pages. I created this application from scratch to demonstrate my skills and knowledge in front-end development.

## Project Purpose And Goal

The main purpose of this project is to apply the skill I just learned. The project has three phases. The first phase is to build the user interface, which allows the user to see the design and layout of the application. The second phase is to make the application functional, which enables the user to reserve a table online. The third phase is the most extensive and complex, as it involves refactoring the entire application as a full-stack e-commerce application with all the features that such an application requires.

## Web Stack And Explaination

![logo1](/logo1.png) ![logo2](/logo2.png) ![logo3](/logo3.png)

**React** is a popular and fast front-end library that helps me create dynamic and interactive user interfaces with ease. I use choose them write JSX syntax to write HTML-like code in JavaScript and leverage the power of hooks, components, props and state management.

**Express**is a minimalist and flexible back-end framework that runs on Node.js. I used it to build RESTful APIs, handle routing, middleware, error handling.

**MongoDB** is a scalable and flexible NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents. I choose it to store querries and data efficiently and reliably. MongoDB also supports various features such as indexing, aggregation, transactions, sharding and replication.
